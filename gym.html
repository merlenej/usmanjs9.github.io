<h4><strong>BUILD THE PERFECT HOME GYM TO ACHIVE YOUR FITNESS GOALS</strong></h4>
<img src="images/fitimg57.jpg" class="img-fluid xx"><br>
<p>Time was that building a home gym was something only one-percenters could consider: gleaming equipment, metric tons of dumbbells, and a butler in the corner holding your workout towel.

But these days, plenty of people — more than 25 million, according to recent stats — get their sweat on in the privacy of their own homes, and it’s easy to see why. A home gym is always accessible, never crowded. You can play whatever music you like. And you never have to work in with anyone, wipe their sweat off a bench, or wait for them to finish taking a selfie.

The two major factors that deter people from making the leap to home training? Space and expense. But if you loosen your grip on the Hollywood-style home-gym fantasy, you’ll see that neither factor has to be an obstacle to building a functional exercise space.

“When many people think about setting up a home gym, they immediately think about recreating a commercial gym — squat rack, bench, barbell, weight plates, dumbbell rack… the list goes on,” says Trevor Thieme, director of fitness and nutrition content for Openfit. That’s a mistake: while the latest gear and gizmos can be fun, they are by no means indispensable for building muscle or shedding fat.

“At the most basic level, all you need to establish a home gym is six square feet of space,” says Thieme. “Your body can be your barbell. Any equipment you layer on top of that is gravy and expands your potential exercise arsenal.”One great thing about fitness equipment: the important stuff (barbells, dumbbells, etc.) lasts forever. And unlike a nick on a classic car, you don’t have to sweat the occasional scuff and scrape on a squat rack or weight plate. Signs of use are just evidence of your dedication and badassery.

So start simple — and allow your gym to grow right along with your strength and cardiovascular fitness. Below, we take you through the process of putting together the perfect home gym for your needs, goals, and budget.</p>
<h5>How to Fill Your Home Gym on Any Budget</h5>
<p>Get resourceful and expense doesn’t have to be a barrier to entry</p>
<h5>Buy new (most expensive)</h5>
<p>This should be a last resort for durable items like dumbbells, but dedicated retailers like Dick’s or Big Five can represent a better option for big-ticket items with lots of moving parts, like treadmills or weight machines. In the latter case, buying new also makes it more likely that you’ll get something that won’t break within a few weeks or months of ownership.</p>
<h5> Buy used (moderately expensive)</h5>
<p>If you’re not into the junkyard look, go the secondhand route. People sell used fitness equipment all the time, often at very reduced prices. Click through Facebook Marketplace, Letgo, Craigslist, or Offerup and there’s a good chance you’ll find what you’re looking for, especially if you live within driving distance of a metropolitan area. If you buy online, beware of retailers masquerading as individual sellers (you’ll know immediately by their asking price)</p>
<h5>Make it yourself</h5>
<p>If you’re willing to go the Rocky route, you can find, make, or repurpose most of what you need. A sturdy chair or coffee table can work well for step-ups. Old paint cans or bleach bottles filled with water or cement can work as homemade hand weights. A tractor tire can be great for deadlifts, jumps, and conditioning exercises.</p>
<h5>What Equipment Do I Really Need for My Home Gym Eveyday?</h5>
<p>With just a few key pieces of equipment, you can be off to the races. Or at least training for one.</p>
<h5>Weights</h5>
<p>In Scotland, budding warriors lift clach cuid fir — manhood stones (which are actual stones despite their cheeky name). In prison, convicts lift stacks of newspapers. Military units stationed abroad lift kegs, buckets of gravel, and jugs of water.

Lifting implements don’t have to be fancy to be brutally effective. Arguably, the tougher something is to hold and heft, the more effective it can be at building functional strength.

But if you’ve got some money to spend and no interest in lugging a 200-pound clach cuid fir into your garage, pony up for whatever heavy stuff interests you. Here are some of your best choices.
Adjustable dumbbells

There are two varieties: the new-school type that adjust with the twist of a knob or the movement of a pin, and the old-school ‘bells you load up with plates like mini-barbells. One offers ease of use, the other saves money.</p>

<h5>Space</h5>
<p>First and foremost, you need space to move. Indoors, this can be a basement, a garage, or a spare room, but don’t dismiss outdoor options like a backyard or terrace. Working out in nature has proven health and mood-elevating benefits. Whatever spot you choose, make sure you have enough floor or ground space to lie down and move your limbs in all directions, and enough overhead space to extend your arms fully when jumping.

Once you’ve designated a space for working out, you already have a wealth of no-equipment exercise options at your disposal, including countless variations of the pushup, squat, lunge, sit-up, plank, and bridge that will keep you busy and challenged for a long, long time. For some of the best bodyweight-only workouts you can do, check out the library of programs on Openfit.</p>
<h5>Power rack</h5>
<p>We’re putting this item way down the list for a couple of reasons. First, it’s typically expensive. And second, it’s not necessary. The only two moves that really require a rack are the barbell squat and the barbell bench press, and both can be performed with dumbbells sans rack. That said, having a rack in your home gym definitely increases your badass quotient, and is important for doing barbell exercises without a spotter. So if you have the space and can afford one, go for it.If you’ve got a thousand bucks to spend, spring for the Rogue R4 Power Rack. It’s nearly unbreakable, beautifully constructed, and comes complete with both fat and skinny pull-up bars.
If that’s a little rich for your blood, you can pick up a Rogue 90″ Monster Lite Squat Stand for about half the price.</p>
