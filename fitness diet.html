     <h4>EAT SMALL MEALS THROUGHOUT THE DAY</h4>&nbsp
     <img src="images/fitimg38.jpg">
     <p>You may have heard the theory that eating many small meals throughout the day can help keep your metabolism motivated. Unfortunately, this is not a true shortcut to weight loss.

There’s no scientific evidence to support the idea that you can lose more excess fat by eating smaller, more frequent meals. It doesn’t seem to matter when you eat your food—the key seems to be getting just the right amount of nutrition. If it’s easier for you to eat smaller meals more often, go for it! But many people find it difficult to stop once they’ve started, meaning more frequent food breaks add up to more calories consumed. </p>
<h4>DOES PROTEIN MAKE A DIFFERENCE?</h4><br>
<img src="images/fitimg39.jpg">
<p>This one is true-ish. Remember that your body spends some of its energy just burning the calories it consumes, so you actually burn about 10% of the calories you eat just by eating them, on average.

A protein calorie requires a little more work to burn than the average calorie. It’s about double, in fact, but it varies from person to person. A lean person may get more calorie-burning benefit from protein than an obese person.

However, be careful not to forsake carbohydrates as you eat those proteins. Carbs help spare your muscles from natural degradation if you are weightlifting, and for that reason low-carb diets are not recommended for anyone interested in bulking up.</p>&nbsp
<h4>CAFFEINE FOR A SHORT-TERM BOOST</h4><br>
<img src="images/fitimg40.jpg">
<p>What’s that feeling? That buzzing feels like my cells have come alive, and they’re melting off unwanted body fat! Or maybe it’s just the jitters.

Many studies have found only a small, insignificant weight loss benefit from caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, green tea, or other sources. For instance, one large meta study looked at 15 other studies and a total of 1,945 participants. The meta study’s authors concluded that green tea used to stimulate weight loss seemed to have a “small, statistically non-significant” impact. </p>
<h4>METABOLIC BOOST ALTERNATIVES</h4>
<img src="images/fitimg41.jpg">
<p>So the bad news? Drinking a lot more water, consuming more caffeine, eating smaller meals and building muscle are all largely insignificant when it comes to shedding pounds. But that doesn’t mean you should just give up on raising your metabolism. There is one part of the metabolic equation that can be used to your weight-losing advantage.

Remember when we talked about the Thermal Effect of Physical Activity (TEPA)? TEPA may account for 15% of the calories you use up—but it could be as much as 30%. That means increasing activity helps you expend more calories. And that’s not just counting exercise. So if you tap your feet at work, walk the stairs instead of taking the elevator, or nod your head to the music as you drive, you’re still burning more calories throughout the day than you would be otherwise. Just a bit of fidgeting won’t matter much, but finding ways to stay a little more active throughout the day can make a big difference over time.</p>
<h4>CONDITIONS CAUSING UNUSAULLY SLOW METABOLISM</h4>
<img src="images/fitimg42.jpg">
<p>Sometimes you really do have a slow metabolism. There are a few potential reasons for this, one which you can control, and others you can’t.
Crash Diets

This one is within your control. You shouldn’t starve yourself to lose weight. Not only is it painful and saps you of your energy, but eating way too few calories can actually cause your body’s chemistry to slow, thus making it more difficult to shed pounds in the future.

    Men should eat no fewer than 1,800 calories per day.
    Women should eat no fewer than 1,200 calories per day.

Some other consequences of crash diets include lost musculature, poor nutrition, and the very real likelihood that you will over-react to the deprivation by overeating in the future. Some problems that affect your metabolism are listed:
Cushing's Syndrome
This is a rare condition that causes too much of the hormone cortisol to flood the body. Symptoms include redness in the face, fatigue, excessive hair growth in women, high blood pressure, and weight gain.

Hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism is a common health condition. Statistics vary, but anywhere from 1% to 5% of the population may be affected. Hypothyroidism results from not enough thyroid being produced by the thyroid gland, which is found in the front of your neck. It can cause fatigue, slowed speech, sensitivity to cold, numbness, and weight gain. Pituitary Gland Disorders (Hypopituitarism)
This condition encompasses several rare disorders that affect one or more of the seven hormones produced by the pituitary gland. Symptoms vary significantly, but may include weight gain, weight loss, or difficulty losing weight.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome

PCOS is also common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women of childbearing age. Its cause is unknown, but may be related to high levels of insulin or androgens. PCOS symptoms include excessive hair, missed periods, acne, and weight gain.</p>

      <p>Every so often a diet trend emerges (or re-emerges) and dominates in the media, on store shelves, and at nutritionists’ offices. Right now that trend is the ketogenic diet, which has been credited with meteoric weight loss among other benefits.

But controversy rages over the efficacy of the diet, which promotes slashing carbohydrates in order to burn more fat. The regimen can be hard to maintain even without physical activity — what happens when you combine a keto diet and bodybuilding?</p> 
<h5>What Is a Ketogenic Diet?</h5>
<p>Before discussing the implications of pairing keto and weightlifting, you should first understand the premise of the ketogenic diet. Typical meal options within a keto diet include eggs, meats, cheese, fibrous vegetables, oils, butters, and nuts. While there’s no doubt most of us will get our fill of fats and proteins, decidedly lacking here are carbohydrates.

That’s because a ketogenic diet prescribes cutting carbohydrates and increasing fat intake with the intention of placing your body into ketosis. In this metabolic state, the body uses stored fat instead of carbs as its primary fuel source.

Most cells in the body prefer the blood sugar, or glucose, that derives from carbs. However, when that isn’t available, stored fat is broken down into ketones as fuel. You reach ketosis when ketones number more than normal.

Once ketosis is achieved, many cells will run on ketones for energy until you consume carbohydrates again. A medical standard for time to reach ketosis remains elusive, but it’s been studied to take as few as two days of limiting daily carbohydrate intake to 20–50 grams for your body to shift from circulating glucose to ketones for energy.</p>
<h5>Can I Do Keto and Bodybuilding Together?</h5>
<p>Given the energy demands required for intense weightlifting, a ketogenic lifestyle isn’t really compatible with a bodybuilding regimen. According to Openfit Nutrition Manager Andrea N. Giancoli, MPH, RD, while it’s possible to lift weights on a ketogenic diet, your body will need carbs for serious bodybuilding activity, something obviously lacking during ketosis.

“You need 5–7 grams of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight for weightlifting,” she says. Which, based on the above carbohydrate intake imposed by a ketogenic diet, works out fine if you weigh 13 pounds.

Carbohydrate provides fuel for muscles, which store the vital macronutrient as glycogen to power through strength-training sessions. A lack of glucose in the diet means a decrease in glycogen stores in the muscles, resulting in compromised athletic performance.

Men and women who lift weights two or more times a week need at least half of their calories to come from carbohydrate sources. Of course, that doesn’t mean you should get your fill on pasta, pizza, and white bread. Quality carbohydrates containing fiber, like beans, quinoa, and whole-grain bread, are what you should lean toward.</p>
<h5>Can You Build Muscle on a Low-Carb Diet?</h5>
<p>It’s possible to build muscle on a low-carb diet, but it’s not recommended — and it can take far longer. University of South Florida researcher Dr. Dominic D’Agostino, Ph.D., who is also a national qualified bodybuilder, says it’s common for people to jump into the keto diet expecting it to work from day one. But the body can take weeks or even months to fully adapt to ketosis.

“A keto diet can lead to poor performance, as it decreases muscle fullness since the muscles won’t be as hydrated,” D’Agostino says. That’s because, to every gram of carbohydrate, the body assigns three grams of water.

Also, a standard ketogenic diet generally prescribes getting 55–60 percent of your calories from fat. D’Agostino notes that such a breakdown doesn’t leave a lot of room for protein.

The body’s basic building block for muscle, a consistent supply of protein throughout the day is critical for optimal muscle growth since it isn’t stored. Without an adequate amount of protein, your body won’t sufficiently build, maintain, or repair muscle tissue.</p>
<p>When you consume carbohydrates, your body transports them into muscles as glucose for energy. Weightlifting on a keto diet means missing out on that fuel source. As a result, you’ll likely experience declines in performance on a ketogenic diet.

“Creatine is your primary fuel source for the first 10 seconds of each set,” says Openfit Senior Fitness and Nutrition Content Manager Trevor Thieme, CSCS. “But after that your muscles run primarily on glucose, which comes from carbohydrates.”

And if you’re a bodybuilder, you know how important form is. Without the energy necessary to perform at your fullest, form may also become a casualty of a keto diet. That can not only cost you gains, but also heighten your risk of injury.

Furthermore, there’s a transition period while switching to a keto diet, and until your body gets used to it, you may also notice side effects like fatigue, dizziness, headache, and nausea.</p>
<h5>What Is the Best Diet for Weightlifting?</h5>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all diet for bodybuilders, but there are dietary principles to keep in mind when trying to build muscle and strength.</p>
<h5>1.Balance your macros</h5>
<p>Depending on whether you want to bulk up and then lean out, or gradually build lean mass, your mix of macros matters. To increase weight gained from fat, those macros should emphasize carbs as well as fat, since the latter is the densest calorically. The bulk of that fat should come from unsaturated sources such as avocado, olive oil, and salmon.</p>
<h5>2.Eat more protein</h5>
<p>When lifting weights regularly, it’s important to get sufficient protein in your diet so you can benefit from muscle growth, repair, and recovery. For high-protein meals — especially after a workout — 20 grams is generally considered optimal for muscle growth. Research suggests that the body doesn’t use much more than 20 grams for muscle growth at a time.</p>
<h5>3.Get enough calories</h5>
<p>Running a calorie deficit is a pathway to weight loss, not muscle gain. To determine how many calories you should consume in order to gain weight, identify how many calories you would need if you didn’t move at all in a given day — i.e., your base metabolic rate (BMR) — then calculate calories burned by daily activity and exercise. Any calories consumed above that represent a surplus.</p>

        <P>Competing in a mud run is a fun way to flex your athletic skills and bond with friends and strangers alike. But no matter what distance you’re participating in, proper nutrition is critical for fueling success — not only on event day, but also during training and especially in the days leading up to your event.

So what should you eat before a Tough Mudder to make sure you have the stamina you need to power through those obstacles and get across the finish line? Here’s what to eat at every stage of your mud run training to ensure optimal performance on event day.</P>
<h5>What to Eat While You’re Training for a Tough Mudder</h5>
<p>When you’re training for a mud run, “carbs are king,” says Trevor Thieme, C.S.C.S., senior fitness and nutrition content manager at Openfit.

Carbohydrates should always make up the bulk of your calories, but they’re especially important in the weeks and days leading up to your event. Of course, you also need to make sure that you’re getting enough protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals to help your body recover from and adapt to your training.

How much is “enough” of each macro- and micronutrient? There’s no single answer that works for everyone — it depends on a number of factors, including your gender, fitness level, training frequency and intensity, overall daily activity level, and body composition. It also depends on whether you’re trying to lose, gain, or maintain your weight during your Tough Mudder training.

That’s why the Openfit TOUGH MUDDER T-MINUS 30 Nutrition Plan and Training Guide breaks down how many calories and nutrients you need based on your personal goals, so you know exactly what you need to eat before your mud run.</p>
<h5>What to Eat in the Week Leading up to a Tough Mudder</h5>
<p>Carbs are a must throughout your Tough Mudder training, but they’re even more important in the days leading up to your big event.

“Your muscles run on carbs — glucose, specifically,” Thieme says, adding that glucose is stored as glycogen in your muscles and liver. “If you don’t start the event with your glycogen stores topped off, you’re not maximizing your chances for athletic success.”

Thieme recommends “carb loading” — aka eating more carbs than usual — in the three days leading up to your mud run (woohoo!). Most people have enough glycogen to support about 90 to 120 minutes of hard exercise, but during intense training, like the type you’ll likely be doing in preparation for a Tough Mudder, it’s hard to tell whether your stores are topped off. Carb loading, aka glycogen supercompensation, helps ensure that they are, so you won’t “hit the wall” while trying to climb over one.

Pasta, potatoes, fruits, veggies — these are all good choices when carb loading. The key is to eat enough to feel full but not stuffed, and to include about 20 grams of protein per meal. For example, you can have a bean and rice burrito with a side of guacamole and salsa for lunch, followed by a shrimp and brown rice stir-fry for dinner.</p>
<h5>What to Eat on the Day of Your Tough Mudder Event</h5>
<p>About three to four hours before the official event starting time, eat a small (about 300 to 500 calories) carb-rich meal to top off your glycogen stores. “Also try to get some carbs into your body at least an hour before you start the course to top off your glucose,” advises Thieme.

And don’t forget to drink water before the event — you can seriously hinder your performance if you go into a Tough Mudder without the proper hydration.

“Most people go through their days slightly dehydrated,” Thieme says — and at no time is that more of a problem than during an event like Tough Mudder. “Even slight dehydration can have a significant effect on athletic performance.”

Start hydrating at least two hours before the event starts. You should pee at least once in the few hours leading up to the event, and you’ll know you’re hydrated if your pee is clear or pale yellow.</p>
<h5> 
What NOT to Eat Before a Mud Run</h5>
<p>You’ll face enough challenges on a Tough Mudder course without worrying about tummy troubles — and using the bathroom isn’t exactly easy when you’re caked in mud — so steer clear of high-fiber foods in the hours before you line up.

And to keep from feeling fatigued midway through the course, you may also want to avoid eating anything high in protein and fat the morning of the event. “They’re slower to digest and will just weigh you down,” Thieme says.
