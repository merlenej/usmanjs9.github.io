  	<h4><strong>THE BEST BACK EXERCISES FOR ALL LEVELS OF GYM-GOER</strong></h4>
    <img src="images/fitimg.jpg" class="img-fluid sdd">
    
  	 <p>Work on your back with these fine moves. People who are into physique training like to talk about achieving the V-shaped torso, and if that’s on your to-do list you’re going to want to dedicate some time to working your latissimus dorsi – AKA your lats – because bulking them up will leave you with a broad, powerful-looking back. Even if this is the first time you’ve heard the phrase V-shaped torso, what we’re about to tell you next should still make you want to keep reading. The lats are responsible for a huge range of movements and a strong set of lats <a href="posture.html">promote good posture </a>– and who doesn’t want to improve their posture?

Unsure where to start? We’ve got your back. Here are a few of our favourite lats exercises.</p>
<h4>Lat pull-down</h4>
<p>Remember when we said pull-ups are hard? This pull-up-like exercise can help you build up to them. There are no prizes for guessing which muscles the lat pull-down works, but there are definitely rewards for those who do it.

Sit in the lat pull-down machine with your legs beneath the padding. Grasp the bar with both arms extended,<a href="lowerbdwkt.html"> keeping your back straight</a>. Slowly pull the bar down towards your chest, pause, then allow the bar to rise again under control – the release is just as important as the pulling phase.</p>
<h4>Reverse-grip barbell bent-over row</h4>
<p>If the hanging and the slamming weren’t taking your fancy, rowing might be the exercise for you. Stand in front of a barbell with your feet shoulder-width apart and a slight bend in the knees. Making sure your back is straight throughout, bend forwards – hinging at the hips – until your torso is nearly parallel to the ground. Grasp the barbell with an underhand grip, palms facing away from you, and hold it around shin height. Pull the barbell in towards your stomach, keeping your elbows tight to your body, until the bar touches your sternum, then lower slowly.</p>
<h4><strong>Advanced Back Exercises</strong></h4>
<p> People have a tendency to take their back for granted right up until the moment something goes wrong. We slump for hours at our desks before <a href="general fitness.html">heading to the gym to work</a> solely on the muscles we can see, like the biceps, chest and abs, not worrying too much about those we can’t. All of this is – you can see where this is going, can’t you? – a huge mistake.

A strong back is the foundation of many of the big lifts you’ll tackle in the gym and key to maintaining good posture in your everyday life. And if you’re motivated by aesthetics as much as practical reasons rest assured that a bigger, broader back is going to make you look dynamite on the beach.

Below you’ll find videos and explanations for the best beginner, intermediate and advanced back exercises as selected by strength and conditioning <a href="hiring a coach.html"> coach Richard Tidmarsh</a> , founder of Reach Fitness. All the exercises can be scaled to your level by adding or removing weight, so even if you fancy yourself an expert in the gym don’t skip the beginner moves – they’re just as important as the other exercises and well worth mastering first.

Tidmarsh has also given his suggestions for sets and reps for each exercise so you can build them all into the ultimate back workout, should you so desire.</p>
<h5>Dumbbell pull-over</h5>
<p>If after all the pulling, slamming and rowing you feel like you need a little lie-down, finish your session with this move. Take care when selecting a weight and if in doubt go lighter. You’re going to be holding that weight above that gorgeous mug of yours.

Lie with your head and back flat on a bench, and your feet flat on the ground, holding one dumbbell in both hands with your arms extended above your chest. Keeping your arms extended, lower the dumbbell behind your head until it’s roughly level with your head, then bring it back up to above your chest. If you start to feel discomfort in your shoulders, don’t lower <a href="weight loss.html">the weight </a> any further; instead, go and work on your shoulder mobility and/or pick a lighter dumbbell.</p>
<h4>Pull-up</h4>
<p>Nothing works your lats quite as well as a proper pull-up and, unlike with some moves on this list, you don’t have to pay as much attention to keeping your back straight because gravity will take care of that for you. Just don’t beat yourself up if you struggle when you’re starting out – pull-ups are hard.

Hang from a pull-up bar with your arms extended, hands shoulder-width apart and your palms facing away from you. Brace your core and slowly pull yourself up (keeping your back straight, of course) until your neck is above the bar. Pause, then lower in an equally controlled manner until your arms are straight again.</p>
<h4>Single-arm cable row</h4>
<p>Set a cable to bellybutton height. Step away from the machine holding the cable in one hand. Drop into a squat before pulling the cable back at the same time as you drive back up. Add a body twist (as in the video) when you feel like you have mastered the movement pattern.</p>
<h4>Bent-over row</h4>
<p>Deadlift a barbell for one rep, then hinge forwards until your torso is at a roughly 45° angle to the floor. With your back ramrod-straight, pull the bar in to your bellybutton with no kick from your legs or hips. <a href="stronger.html"> Squeeze your back muscles</a>, then lower the bar slowly.</p>
<h4>Chin-up</h4>
<p>With an underhand grip, grasp the bar with your hands shoulder-width apart. Slowly drop to full extension, then pull your chest up to the bar, keeping your elbows in. Lower slowly back to full extension – take three seconds. This exercise can be made easier by using a resistance band for assistance.</p>
