  	<h4><strong>MEN'S FITNESS DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO FAT-LOSS</strong></h4>
    <img src="images/fitimg69.jpg" class="img-fluid">
  	 <p>There’s a way you can lose a dozen kilos in just six weeks. Unfortunately, it’s called a hunger strike. To lose fat rather than muscle, to avoid bringing your metabolism to a screeching halt, to elude fat rebound wherein the day you stop dieting you immediately start gaining lard, and to become healthier instead of nearly decomposing, you can reasonably aim to drop about a kilo a week. The following 15 fat-loss tips are designed to help you turn your body in the right direction over the next six weeks. But do yourself a favour: make these healthy habits into a permanent part of your diet and they’ll take you all the way to optimal health.</p>
    <h5>1. Crawl before you walk</h5>
    <p>If you’ve been eating poorly, not exercising, and burning your candle at both ends, don’t try to transform your entire lifestyle overnight. It’s a recipe for failure. “People who have lived this way for a number of years – thereby damaging their metabolisms – will change all their habits and feel terrible, because the new habits unmask the damage,” says Schwarzbein. “Then they go running back to their old habits.” Instead, <a href="fitness diet.html">change your diet</a> first, and do it step-by-step. Find a way to manage stress (walking, yoga, meditation), then wean yourself off any chemical dependencies, including sugar. Finally, build yourself a workout routine.

If you start backsliding because your new lifestyle doesn’t feel like you, keep the following proverb in mind: “All new behaviours cause anxiety. That’s normal. This discomfort will pass in three minutes.” Then drink cold water. </p>
<h5>2. learn how to cook a little </h5>
<p>Adults who eat out frequently are significantly fatter than those who dine in, according to a university study. This is the result of the tendency to eat larger portions and less balanced meals in restaurants.For busy guys who don’t enjoy cooking – show of hands? – this habit can be hard to change. But by taking it slow and learning simple recipes that are healthy and taste good, you can achieve great results in time. To begin: slice up chicken breasts, capsicum and zucchini; sauté them in olive oil and teriyaki sauce; throw it over some boiled rice. You just cooked. For more ideas, get yourself to a bookstore, which is teeming with variations on the “Cooking for People Who Aren’t Sure Where Their Kitchen Is” franchise. Other good sources for simple recipes are manufacturer and food-board web sites. Mystified by avocados? Decipher them at avocado.org.au. Confounded by that carton of eggs? Crack on to eggs.org.au for recipes galore. </p>
<h5>3.Turn up the density</h5>
<p>Call it food efficiency. One of the keys to shedding flab is getting more nutrition per calorie consumed so that you fill up quickly, stay satisfied longer – which minimises hunger – and get all the nutrients you need despite eating fewer calories.

“When you eat a balance of nutritionally dense foods, including protein, healthy fats, unprocessed carbohydrates, fresh <a href="low carb vegitable.html">fruits and non-starchy vegetables,</a> your food digests more slowly. This keeps your blood-glucose levels steady,” explains Dr Diana Schwarzbein, an endocrinologist and author of The Schwarzbein Principle (amazon.com). “Hunger signals result mainly from a drop in blood-glucose levels.”Getting a good mix in your menu is easier at night when you have time to think about what you’re cooking (or ordering), but it’s tougher when you’re in a hurry. For breakfast, follow a V8 aperitif with a cup of low-fat yoghurt sprinkled with muesli and berries. For lunch, try a PBB (peanut butter and banana) on wholegrain bread with some carrot sticks, or a TLT (turkey-lettuce-tomato) on oat bread smeared lightly with light mayonnaise, with an apple for dessert. </p>
<h5>4. Keep score </h5>
<p>Successful fat losers keep a tally. “It’s called self-monitoring,” says food scientist Dr Jean Harvey-Berino. “Consciously tracking your health-related behaviours by keeping exercise and food logs is a very effective way to keep yourself moving in the right direction.”

Make sure to note periods of high energy and low energy. When you analyse the logs, you’ll realise why you experience these reactions and adjust your eating and training accordingly.It’s helpful to assess your progress using scales, a tape measure and/or a body-fat monitor. But give yourself every second or third day off. That will help keep you from obsessing over constant minor weight fluctuations, most of which will be water in or water out. </p>
<h5>5.Gain weight</h5>
<p>Muscle weight, that is. Gaining lean muscle mass – which you probably want to do anyway because it speeds up your metabolism and, oh, by the way, it looks good – is also an excellent way to lose fat. “Muscle requires more energy to maintain itself,” says Kleiner. “Each kilo of muscle you add to your body burns an extra 60 to 100 calories a day.” Therefore, it’s important that your program incorporate both cardiovascular exercise and resistance training. Schwarzbein advises her clients to do an hour of resistance exercise three times a week, half an hour of cardio on three alternate days, and daily stretching, which will keep your tendons,<a href="7 supplements.html"> ligaments and muscles flexible</a> and your body stress-free. Still, studies show that 90 percent of weight loss comes from diet changes. So don’t expect putting in marathon sessions on the elliptical machine to make up for that stuffed-crust pizza. </p>
<h5>6.hoof it </h5>
<p>Formal exercise isn’t the only way to burn extra calories. You can also torch a few more each day by walking to the post office instead of driving, climbing the stairs instead of taking the lift, and otherwise relying on your body instead of a machine toget you from here to there.You’ve probably heard this advice before. And you’re probably still driving to the corner store. “It’s because everybody’s always late,” says Kleiner. “The key to putting this advice into practice is better planning and setting it as a priority.”It’s important to realise how quickly these minor activities can add up. They may seem insignificant, but people who are consistently on the go can add 20 percent to their energy expenditure. Just staying still for 5 minutes burns 6 calories, but you can burn twice as many by making your bed, four times as many by walking, six times as many by gardening and nine times as many climbing stairs.

<h5>7.Plan your snacks</h5>
<p>When you’re away from home and you feel your stomach rumbling, chances are the most readily available options will be of the junk-food variety. And chances are you will succumb – unless you plan ahead. Nutritionist Susan Dopart advises her clients to anticipate these hunger pangs and carry convenient, nutritious snacks such as dried fruit and whole-grain cereal bars. Ironically, to get the biggest hunger-busting bang for your snacking buck, always include a little fat, which is the slowest-digesting macronutrient of all. Try a tablespoon of reduced-fat peanut butter on celery stalks, or a small box of sultanas and a square of chocolate. Neither of these munchies will cost you more than 250 calories and 6 grams of fat. </p>
<h5>8.drink to your health</h5>
<p>Many guys who are conscious of what they eat remain oblivious to the impact of what fills their glasses. Pulp-free fruit juices (which at least have vitamins), alcohol and soft drinks add a large number of calories to the average Australian’s daily intake. Satisfy your cravings for flavour with solid foods and douse your thirst with water. If you need a beer to unwind in the evening, try to make it a light one – or two at the most. If you’re a three-can man, you’ll dilute your 6-week weight-loss program to the tune of 12,600 calories.</p>
<h5>9.Drop the fat bombs </h5>
<p>Your body needs – and can burn – every kind of fat except one: trans fats, those mutant pseudo-nutrients created through the refining of healthy oils. They’re found in most fried foods and processed baked goods; the red flag on the ingredient list is “partially hydrogenated vegetable oil”. Stay away from this crap if you’re serious about weight loss and heart health. While <a href="weight loss.html">successful weight loss</a> can’t be based solely on denial, fat grenades such as fast-food fries simply must be renounced if you’re going to succeed. “If you want to treat yourself, you’re much better off having one piece of chocolate [which contains healthy anti-oxidants] than making an entire meal out of foods that have no redeeming value whatsoever,” recommends Kleiner. </p>
<h5>10.Slow down</h5>
<p>Stress will make you fat as surely as fast food will. “When you’re chronically stressed, your adrenal glands are continuously releasing cortisol, which in the long term causes your body to hold fat and redistribute it along the waistline,” says Schwarzbein. Don’t think you’re stressed? Think again.

“Stress is not a matter of being unhappy or irritable,” she explains. “It’s a matter of doing too much day to day.” If you’re getting too little sleep and depending on caffeine and sugar for energy, your adrenal glands are probably working overtime – and fattening you up. Your body also pumps cortisol during your long commute to work, when you’re waiting with your in-laws. Stress and its companion cortisol are everywhere, but you can control both with such simple efforts as brisk walks of 4 or 5 kilometres three times a week. Or resistance training three times a week. Deep-breathing exercises, meditation and stretching programs all provide measurable relief. </p>
<h5>11.High-intensity interval training</h5>
<p>HIIT gives you a well-rounded workout while burning a ton of fat and calories. “HIIT workouts can vary greatly, from 500 calories per hour to 1500-plus calories per hour for an 180-lb man,” says Ryan. “HIIT workouts are great because of the intensity of each exercise as well as the variation of exercises and reps.” Pairing any body-weight movement with a weighted movement and a traditional cardio element and you have the perfect recipe for an amazing fat-burner.</p>
<h6><strong>The best way to do it:</strong></h6>
<p>: Look for Tabata, HIIT, high-impact aerobic, and vigorous interval classes using weights at your local gym. No gym or class? Check out these 10 HIIT workouts to get shredded. Be sure to keep rest periods to a minimum to really maximize your efforts.</p>
<h5>12.Swimming </h5>
<p>Swimming is <a href="bodyu.html">a total-body workout</a> that starts the second you begin treading water. “You’re essentially fighting gravity, so your muscles are working extra hard to keep you afloat without getting a break until you’re out of the water,” says Boudro. “In fact, with just one minut
e of fast swimming, you’ll burn 14 calories.”

Remember that the type of stroke makes a difference, Adams says. “A breast stroke burns fewer calories than the butterfly, so be sure to incorporate different strokes in your training.”</p>
<h6><strong>The best way to burn fat while swimming: </strong></h6>
<p>An easy way to burn calories in the water is to simply tread water. You can do a few laps, then have a water-treading interval, then repeat. “If you’re able to swim at a high level, then swim as fast as you can for as long as possible,” says Adams. “If you aren’t such a strong swimmer, then do swimming intervals: Swim as fast as you can down the length of the pool and back, then swim slower for the same distance.” Alternate these intervals for the duration of your workout.</p>
<h5>13. Jumping Rope</h5>
<p>There’s a reason the jump rope is a mainstay in a boxer’s training regimen: it’s cheap, easy to do, increases foot speed, and burns a ton of calories. Think of your favorite boxers, wrestlers, and fighters—they all jump rope. “Jumping rope not only enhances your footwork, shoulder strength, and coordination, but also simulates sprinting, allowing you to burn as much as 500 calories in just 30 minutes,” says Ben Boudro, C.S.C.S., owner of Xceleration Fitness in Auburn Hills</p>
<h6><strong>While very few people can jump rope for 30 minutes straight, it’s best to do intervals of fast and slow jumps to keep you going. Can’t do that very well? Jump as fast as you can for one minute, then rest for 20-30 seconds. Repeat until you’re done. If you’re a frequent traveler, throw a jump rope in your suitcase for a great workout without ever having to leave the hotel room.</strong></h6>
<h5>14.Elliptical </h5>
<p>These machines were originally designed to minimise impact on the knees and hips, but still allow a great workout. “Because the impact is quite low, the calorie-burning effect isn’t as great as other cardio machines, like treadmills and stairmasters,” explains Roger Adams, Ph.D., an expert in nutrition and weight loss. “However, the elliptical machine can be an excellent way to burn calories without wearing out your joints.” While the average 180-lb. man may only burn close to 500-600 calories per hour if he’s going at an above moderate pace, you can get even more out of it by switching up the intensity, speed, and resistance.</p>
<h6><strong>The best way to burn fat on an elliptical: </strong></h6>
<p> Add a high incline to really <a href="Calves.html">activate more leg muscles</a>, especially your glutes. “This movement can simulate stair-climbing without the impact,” says Adams. “Lower the incline and increase the resistance and you have a cross-country skiing feel to your workout that really works your quads.” As with the stepmill, don’t hold on to the handles or rails too tightly as this can reduce your efforts and lead to shoulder or wrist pain.</p>
<h5>15.Running</h5>
<p>Running at a steady, moderate pace is a sure way to burn fat and calories, but it’s not the most economical way to build or even maintain muscle.

“By the numbers, a 180-lb. man can burn about 940 calories in an hour while running an 8.5-minute-per-mile pace—or 7 mph on the treadmill for an hour,” says Ryan. “This would be a nice, long run to do every couple of weeks to keep up your aerobic capacity, but it involves a lot of mileage for the time and effort put in.” The cons: Running at this pace can also break down muscle and subject your body to lots of pounding. “If you’re looking to add in a long run every once in awhile, by all means do so, just opt for trails or softer surfaces than cement and blacktop,” he says.</p>
<h6><strong>The best way to burn fat on a long run:</strong></h6>
<p> If you’re running on a treadmill, set the incline to 2-3% to simulate running outside, suggests Adams. “This burns more calories and may actually be easier on the knees.” If running feels boring for you, try different routes in your neighborhood or join a local running club. Running with a partner or group can make the miles go by much easier.</p>
