  	<h4><strong>26 WAYS TO GET STRONGER AND LEANER</strong></h4>
    <img src="images/fitimg72.jpg" class="img-fluid">
    <h5>1.Mind your performance</h5>
    <p>A study on how visualization can help in the weight room found that those who conduct mental exercises of their performance in the gym can lift up to 14% more weight. And studies have shown that the exact same signals that fire when you are actually lifting weights also show up when just thinking about the moves.</p>
    <h5>2. Lighten up</h5>
    <p>Research from McMaster U. in Canada has shown that lifting with lighter weights (up to 50% of max) for 20 to 25 reps, matched the gains gotten when lifting up to 90% of max for eight to 12 reps. The key to it all is making sure you lift till the point of fatigue.</p> 
    <h5>3. Jump for greater muscle gains</h5>
    <p>Don’t neglect agilty work — moves like box jumps will test those unused muscles. On leg days do 3×3, resting 60 seconds between each set— the central nervous system recruits more muscle after explosive exercise.</p>
    <h5>4.Go to bed with casein</h5>
    <p>Supplementing with casein—a slow- digesting protein powder—before you sleep has been shown to stimulate overnight muscle growth. Also, a study from the Journal of Nutrition found that protein supplementation right before sleep boosts muscle synthesis by almost 22%.</p>
    <h5>5.Rest 3 to 5 minutes before a 1RM</h5>
    <p>Your body needs to regenerate as much ATP (adenosine triphosphate)—a cell’s main source of energy—to fuel muscle. Take a moment or two and let your body feel fully recovered before attempting a PR.</p>
    <h5>6.Gym it up, part 3</h5>
    <p>According to a paper published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, both <a href="fat-loss.html">heavy-weight/lower-rep</a> and moderate-weight/higher-rep routines elicit similar gains in muscle growth.</p>
    <h5>7.Don’t always train to failure</h5>
    <p>For new lifters, taking sets to failure during a 5×5 protocol does not lead to greater strength gains than stopping short of failure.</p>
    <h5>8.Gym it up</h5>
    <p>A study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning found that after four weeks of training to failure using 30% 1RM or 80% 1RM, both elicited similar muscle hypertrophy, but only 80% 1RM increased muscle strength.</p>
    <h5>9.Get the band back together</h5>
    <p>Banded side steps are great for improving hip stability and protecting the knees from injury. They can also help strengthen the hips, to prevent the knees from wobbling during squats.</p>
    <h5>10.Get pushy</h5>
    <p>When bench- pressing, actively push your heels into the floor and force your body backward to help turn the press into a full-body exercise.</p>
    <h5>11.Down some joe</h5>
    <p>A study from Coventry University in the United Kingdom reports that drinking a cup of coffee approximately 45 minutes before a squat session can give you close to a 29% bump in weight.</p>
    <h5>12. Bend the bar</h5>
    <p>Another great bench tip: Grip the bar tightly—hands about shoulder-width apart—before starting a lift. Then, when you have the bar up, keep squeezing firmly, trying to “bend” it in half as you press.</p>
    <h5>13.Hang in there</h5>
    <p>Grasping a bar and holding on helps decompress joints and improves grip strength, which helps you lift more.</p>
    <h5>14.Rub it in</h5>
    <p>Getting a massage can reduce inflammation and swelling, so sign up for regular sessions.</p>
  <h5>15. Adjust for age</h5>
    <p>Train the same muscles three times a week for the first year or so, then twice a week when you get stronger.</p>
<h5>16.Beg off the brews</h5>
<p>If you booze before you exercise, muscle biopsies show reduced activity in the chemical pathways tied to muscle growth and recovery.</p>
<h5>17. Spread out</h5>
<p>Do squats and deadlifts as far apart from each other in a training week—or on the same day—as possible so that there’s ample recovery time before the next session.</p>
<h5>18.Add in Vitamin E</h5>
<p> <a href="vitamin.html">Vitamin E,</a> a powerful ­antioxidant and staple of almonds and avocados, is crucial because it helps heal the muscle cellsthat rupture during exercise.</p>
<h5>19.Hit the sack</h5>
<p>Aim for seven to eight hours of restful sleep per night to allow your body the time to replenish nutrients and rebuild muscle.</p>
<h5>20.Train with a gorilla</h5>
<p>Pumping iron with someone who motivates or even intimidates you can push you to up your intensity.</p>
<h5>21.Do cardio after lifting</h5>
<p>Aerobic exercise performed before resistance exercise significantly reduces performance even when unrelated muscle groups are involved.</p>
<h5>22.Consume creatine</h5>
<p>Research published in the journal Nutrients found that 5g of creatine supplementation four times a day for six days gave a group of athletes a 14-pound bump in 1RM in squats.</p>
<h5>23.Squeeze</h5>
<p>Squeezing the bar hard for three to five seconds before your set gives you a connected feeling throughout your body and primes you to stay tight during the lift.</p>
<h5>24.Throw your weight around</h5>
<p>Using machines to train can get you just as big as throwing up free weights, according to a recent study.</p>
<h5>25.Go for a spin</h5>
<p>Light cardio is the best form of active recovery for pretty much any workout. Spin for 10 to 15 minutes on a bike at a low resistance and leisurely rate.</p>
<h5>26.Bend the bar</h5>
<p>Another great bench tip: Grip the bar tightly—hands about shoulder-width apart—before starting a lift. Then, when you have the bar up, keep squeezing firmly, trying to “bend” it in half as you press.</p>
